# WheeRemaining, a World of Warcraft addon

![WHEE! buff](spell_misc_emotionhappy.jpg)

/bufftimers shows buffs that have timers, their maximum duration, and their remaining time.

/wheetimers and /wt display how much time is left on the [WHEE! buff](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=46668/whee) for all alts.

This uses the [AuraUtil.FindAuraByName API](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/f843b3fa8985e275a545bcac9d9577a1bba6f4cd/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_FrameXMLUtil/Mainline/AuraUtil.lua#L69).
